## Project Overview

This project aims to predict Agent Days on Market (ADOM) and home sale prices in the Hunters Green community by leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques. It involves the following steps:

- Data Import: Importing the dataset containing information about home sales in the Hunters Green community.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to gain insights, visualize trends, and identify correlations.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
- Predictive Modeling: Developing regression models to predict ADOM and home sale prices.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics and visualization techniques.
